## Python Code Guidelines
1. **Avoid Deeply Nested Logic**:
   - Refactor code to reduce nesting levels.
   - Use early returns to simplify logic.

2. **Use List Comprehensions Where Appropriate**:
   - Replace loops with list comprehensions for concise and readable code.

3. **Ensure Proper Error Handling**:
   - Use try-except blocks to handle exceptions.
   - Avoid bare except clauses; specify exception types.

4. **Adhere to Pythonic Idioms**:
   - Follow PEP 8 style guide.
   - Use meaningful variable names.
   - Prefer built-in functions and libraries.

5. **Security Best Practices**:
   - Validate and sanitize inputs.
   - Avoid using eval() and exec().
   - Use secure libraries for cryptographic operations.

6. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Avoid unnecessary computations.
   - Use efficient data structures.
   - Profile and optimize bottlenecks.

## General Guidelines
- Write clear and concise comments.
- Ensure code is modular and reusable.
- Include unit tests for critical functions.
